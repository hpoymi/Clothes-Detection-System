# Clothes-Detection-System
The work presents a comprehensive approach to clothing detection using advanced image processing technologies. The main objective of the project was to build, implement and validate an object detection system that focused on accurately identifying clothing items on people from images. Work dedicated to adapting the well-known YOLOv5 model to the requirements of the ModaNet dataset resulted in the successful identification of a variety of clothing. Based on the Flask framework, the system's user interface provides seamless interaction with the system's functions on a variety of devices. The analysis results show that the system effectively identifies clothes, and new features such as the virtual locker and advanced text search provide valuable tools for wardrobe organisation and management. It is worth noting that the work focuses on the problems of model customisation and the need to adhere to high data security standards. In summary, the work presents advanced object detection technologies and their practical applications in the fashion industry. The results show that the system works well, and the conclusions suggest how to improve and develop in the future.
